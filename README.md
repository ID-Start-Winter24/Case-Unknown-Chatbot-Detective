# Detective Chatbot - "Case Unknown" (Group 02)

## What is it?

This is a text-based detective chatbot game where you chat with an AI detective who evaluates your responses, tracks your story, and decides your fate.

You’re accused of a crime you can’t remember. Your goal? Clear your name by answering the detective’s questions. 
Use memory fragments to weave a believable story about last night. Convince the detective, or risk being sent to jail.

Can you outsmart the detective and prove your innocence?

## Features:

* **Dynamic Dialogue:** The detective's responses adapt to your questions and the evolving state of the game, ensuring every interaction feels unique and immersive.

* **Mystery Solving:** Piece together clues and fragmented memories to uncover the truth. Every detail could be the key to solving the case.

* **Message Pressure:** With just 10 opportunities to explain yourself, every response matters.
