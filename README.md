# A Detective Chatbot Game - "Case Unknown" (Group 02)

This repository contains the code for "Case Unknown," a detective chatbot game developed as part of the "Projektmodul Start" course at the Munich University of Applied Sciences. While the project is now concluded and the chatbot is no longer actively hosted, this README provides a summary of the project and its key aspects.

## üïµÔ∏è Project Overview

"Case Unknown" was an interactive detective game built using a chatbot interface. Players were tasked with solving a mystery by interrogating the chatbot, which acted as a rational and slightly cynical detective. The project aimed to explore the potential of chatbot technology for interactive storytelling and game development.

> You‚Äôre accused of a crime you can‚Äôt remember. Your goal? Clear your name by answering the detective‚Äôs questions. 
> Use memory fragments to weave a believable story about last night. Convince the detective, or risk being sent to jail.
>
> Can you outsmart the detective and prove your innocence?
